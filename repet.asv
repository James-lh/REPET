% REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET) class
%   
%   Repetition is a fundamental element in generating and perceiving 
%   structure. In audio, mixtures are often composed of structures where a 
%   repeating background signal is superimposed with a varying foreground 
%   signal (e.g., a singer overlaying varying vocals on a repeating 
%   accompaniment or a varying speech signal mixed up with a repeating 
%   background noise). On this basis, we present the REpeating Pattern 
%   Extraction Technique (REPET), a simple approach for separating the 
%   repeating background from the non-repeating foreground in an audio 
%   mixture. The basic idea is to find the repeating elements in the 
%   mixture, derive the underlying repeating models, and extract the 
%   repeating  background by comparing the models to the mixture. Unlike 
%   other separation approaches, REPET does not depend on special 
%   parameterizations, does not rely on complex frameworks, and does not 
%   require external information. Because it is only based on repetition, 
%   it has the advantage of being simple, fast, blind, and therefore 
%   completely and easily automatable.
%   
%   
%   REPET (original)
%       
%       The original REPET aims at identifying and extracting the repeating 
%       patterns in an audio mixture, by estimating a period of the 
%       underlying repeating structure and modeling a segment of the 
%       periodically repeating background.
%       
%       background_signal = repet.original(audio_signal,sample_rate);
%       
%
%   REPET (extended)
%       
%       The original REPET can be easily extended to handle varying 
%       repeating structures, by simply applying the method along time, on 
%       individual segments or via a sliding window.
%       
%       background_signal = repet.extended(audio_signal,sample_rate);
%
%   
%   Adaptive REPET
%   
%       The original REPET works well when the repeating background is 
%       relatively stable (e.g., a verse or the chorus in a song); however, 
%       the repeating background can also vary over time (e.g., a verse 
%       followed by the chorus in the song). The adaptive REPET is an 
%       extension of the original REPET that can handle varying repeating 
%       structures, by estimating the time-varying repeating periods and 
%       extracting the repeating background locally, without the need for 
%       segmentation or windowing.
%       
%       background_signal = repet.adaptive(audio_signal)
%       
%   
%   REPET-SIM (with self-similarity matrix)
%       
%       The REPET methods work well when the repeating background has 
%       periodically repeating patterns (e.g., jackhammer noise); however, 
%       the repeating patterns can also happen intermittently or without a 
%       global or local periodicity (e.g., frogs by a pond). REPET-SIM is a 
%       generalization of REPET that can also handle non-periodically 
%       repeating structures, by using a similarity matrix to identify the 
%       repeating elements.
%       
%       background_signal = repet.sim(audio_signal)
